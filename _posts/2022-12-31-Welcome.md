We have a great news!
fastexample has born today. The intention of this repository family is to serve developers with code sources relevant for almost every aspect of modern software development. The content of these source snippets are usually small and they focus on specific topics that are easy to implement but causes frustration since they may not be easilly developed after all.
The updates on this page may be seldom or may be regular depending on the contributors time and possibility.
